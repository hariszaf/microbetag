is related to the community structure, the gathering of
vertices into groups such that there is a higher density of edges within groups than between them

Nevertheless, modules in microbial co-occurrence networks may be indicative of ecological processes governing community structure, such as niche filtering and habitat preference

## Interactions 

From [*Earth microbial co-occurrence network reveals interconnection pattern across microbiomes*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-020-00857-2):

Εcological interactions are critical evolutionary pressures for natural selection during microbial evolution. This premise is encapsulated by the Red Queen hypothesis, which emphasizes the coevolution of species, wherein established species evolve cooperatively through conditional dependencies [3]. Alternatively, the Black Queen hypothesis, which states that leaky metabolite production in certain species will lead to a reduction in corresponding functions in other species, provides an optional evolutionary possibility for the development of metabolic dependencies [4] (gene loss).
Adaptation in one species may increase selection pressure on another species, giving rise to antagonistic coevolution. Negative interactions (such as competition, parasitism, and predation) drive evolution by selective pressure [5](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06291), whereas positive interactions (such as mutualism) drive evolution by enhancing biological fitness [6](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15973).



## Evolution 

***Red Queen*** $\rightarrow$ The Constant Extinction Pattern

ecosystems are expected to approach one of two evolutionary modes. 
The first mode, corresponding to the Red Queen condition, is a s.eady state ofchange (even in a constant physical environment) characterized by continuing evolutionary change, extinction and speciation. 
The other is one of evolutionary stasis, wit zero rate of evolution and no extinction or speciation; evolutionary change occurs only in response to changes in the physical environment.


From ["Revisiting Leigh Van Valen’s “A New Evolutionary Law” (1973)"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13752-021-00391-w)
all species change while experiencing “mutually incompatible optima within an adaptive zone. 
A self-perpetuating fluctuation results which can be stated in terms of an unstudied aspect of zero-sum game theory."* In other words, each species tries to improve its fitness, but in doing so it modifies the evolutionary responses of its partners in the ecological network which then also change, triggering further responses in the former.

*each one responds to (and affects) the changes in the others, i.e., the “biotic environment.”*
The consequence would be a rather unexpected one: everyone needs to keep changing to remain in the (evolutionary) game. In that perspective, a reductionist view of ecosystems as sets of species whose fates would depend on environmental changes was replaced by a very different one with extinction being the result of intrinsic, system-level changes.

**highlight**

*a given species may disappear at any time, irrespective of how long it has already existed. ( Law of Constant Extinction)*


*If evolution leads to improvement through adaptation, why do modern mammals have the same extinction probabilities as their ancestors? Enter the Red Queen.*



nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of coevolution. 
Darwin himself recognized this when referring to what he called the entangled bank (Darwin 1859): 
"It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank,clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects fitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth."

Indeed, ecosystems need to be seen as collectives of interacting species whose evolutionary fate is necessarily intermingled in complex ways. Van Valen’s Red Queen hypothesis
(RQH) suggests that  the constant change of the nodes of these networks propagates through the web as other species also respond by evolving themselves. Since change might not happen indefnitely (due to biological constraints) a species unable to cope with change will disappear. Such a hypothesis
was mathematically formulated by Stenseth and Maynard Smith by means of a simple, two-dimensional model representing two variables: the average lag of diferent species
and the number of species (Stenseth and Maynard Smith
1984). These authors showed that a constantly changing
regime can be possible under the absence of environmental
stress.

Host-Parasite Interactions: Negative frequency-dependent selection can also occur in host-parasite interactions, where parasites may become more specialized in infecting the most common host types, leading to an advantage for less common host types.


The model presented by these authors proposed a well-defned framework to describe Red Queen

as a species-specifc structure, the landscapes of diferent
species are coupled in such a way that a change in a given
landscape can propagate into the others. 
ueen dynamics as well as punctuated
equilibrium (Eldredge and Gould 1972) would be an inevitable result of a tendency to critical states (Bak et al. 1992;
Gould 2002) where ecosystem-level coevolution will lead
to unpredictable dynamics, efectively decoupling microfrom macroevolution (Solé et al. 1996)

*In game theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a scenario where each participant’s gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other participants.
