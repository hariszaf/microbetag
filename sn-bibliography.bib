  abstract = {Poly[(R)-lactate-co-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [P(LA-co-3HB)] is a biobased polyester with semitransparent and flexible properties produced in engineered bacteria carrying an LA-polymerizing enzyme. In this study, we attempted to isolate the P(enriched LA-co-3HB)-degrading bacteria from soil samples in order to identify enzymes with the capacity to degrade this new type of polymer. Among approximately 500 samples, the Gram-negative bacterium C34, which exhibited potent P(enriched LA-co-3HB)-degrading activity, was isolated based on the decrease in the turbidity of culture medium supplemented with emulsified P(67 mol% LA-co-3HB). Based on its 16S rDNA sequence, this isolated bacterium was identified as a member of Variovorax sp.. Next, we attempted to isolate and purify the depolymerase that contributes to the polymer degradation from the culture supernatant of strain C34. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 42 kDa and exhibited degradation activity towards the P(67 mol% LA-co-3HB) as well as 3HB homopolymer [P(3HB)], but not LA homopolymers (PDLA and PLLA). On the other hand, a well-characterized depolymerase of P(3HB) derived from Alcaligenes faecalis T1 did not degrade P(67 mol% LA-co-3HB), PDLA or PLLA. This result suggests that the newly isolated depolymerase differs from the P(3HB) depolymerase from A. faecalis.}

  abstract = { Variovorax paradoxus is a microorganism of special interest due to its diverse metabolic capabilities, including the biodegradation of both biogenic compounds and anthropogenic contaminants. V. paradoxus also engages in mutually beneficial interactions with both bacteria and plants. The complete genome sequence of V. paradoxus S110 is composed of 6,754,997 bp with 6,279 predicted protein-coding sequences within two circular chromosomes. Genomic analysis has revealed multiple metabolic features for autotrophic and heterotrophic lifestyles. These metabolic diversities enable independent survival, as well as a symbiotic lifestyle. Consequently, S110 appears to have evolved into a superbly adaptable microorganism that is able to survive in ever-changing environmental conditions. Based on our findings, we suggest V. paradoxus S110 as a potential candidate for agrobiotechnological applications, such as biofertilizer and biopesticide. Because it has many associations with other biota, it is also suited to serve as an additional model system for studies of microbe-plant and microbe-microbe interactions. }

  abstract = { The Gram-negative bacterium Variovorax paradoxus strain B4 was isolated from soil under mesophilic and aerobic conditions to elucidate the so far unknown catabolism of mercaptosuccinate (MS). During growth with MS this strain released significant amounts of sulfate into the medium. Tn5::mob-induced mutagenesis was successfully employed and yielded nine independent mutants incapable of using MS as a carbon source. In six of these mutants, Tn5::mob insertions were mapped in a putative gene encoding a molybdenum (Mo) cofactor biosynthesis protein (moeA). In two further mutants the Tn5::mob insertion was mapped in the gene coding for a putative molybdopterin (MPT) oxidoreductase. In contrast to the wild type, these eight mutants also showed no growth on taurine. In another mutant a gene putatively encoding a 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (paaH2) was disrupted by transposon insertion. Upon subcellular fractionation of wild-type cells cultivated with MS as sole carbon and sulfur source, MPT oxidoreductase activity was detected in only the cytoplasmic fraction. Cells grown with succinate, taurine, or gluconate as a sole carbon source exhibited no activity or much lower activity. MPT oxidoreductase activity in the cytoplasmic fraction of the Tn5::mob-induced mutant Icr6 was 3-fold lower in comparison to the wild type. Therefore, a new pathway for MS catabolism in V. paradoxus strain B4 is proposed: (i) MPT oxidoreductase catalyzes the conversion of MS first into sulfinosuccinate (a putative organo-sulfur compound composed of succinate and a sulfino group) and then into sulfosuccinate by successive transfer of oxygen atoms, (ii) sulfosuccinate is cleaved into oxaloacetate and sulfite, and (iii) sulfite is oxidized to sulfate. }

  abstract = { The current study gives a detailed insight into mutualistic collaboration of microalgae and bacteria, including the involvement of competitive interplay between bacteria. We provide experimental evidence that Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Dyadobacter, Porphyrobacter, and Variovorax are the key players in a Scenedesmus quadricauda alga-bacteria interaction. Microalgae are one of the most dominant forms of life on earth that is tightly associated with a distinct and specialized microbiota. We have previously shown that the microbiota of Scenedesmus quadricauda harbors less than 10 distinct microbial species. Here, we provide evidence that dominant species are affiliated with the genera of Variovorax, Porphyrobacter, and Dyadobacter. Experimental and transcriptome-based evidence implies that within this multispecies interaction, Dyadobacter is a key to alga growth and fitness and is highly adapted to live in the phycosphere. While presumably under light conditions the alga provides the energy source to the bacteria, Dyadobacter produces and releases mainly a large variety of polysaccharides modifying enzymes. This is coherent with high-level expression of the T9SS in alga cocultures. The transcriptome data further imply that quorum-quenching proteins (QQ) and biosynthesis of vitamins B1, B2, B5, B6, and B9 are expressed by Dyadobacter at high levels in comparison to Variovorax and Porphyrobacter. Notably, Dyadobacter produces a significant number of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and enzymes involved in bacterial reactive oxygen species (ROS) tolerance. Complementary to this, Variovorax expresses the genes of the biosynthesis of vitamins B2, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12, and Porphyrobacter is specialized in the production of vitamins B2 and B6. Thus, the shared currency between partners are vitamins, microalgae growth-promoting substances, and dissolved carbon. This work significantly enlarges our knowledge on alga-bacteria interaction and demonstrates physiological investigations of microalgae and associated bacteria, using microscopy observations, photosynthetic activity measurements, and flow cytometry. IMPORTANCE The current study gives a detailed insight into mutualistic collaboration of microalgae and bacteria, including the involvement of competitive interplay between bacteria. We provide experimental evidence that Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Dyadobacter, Porphyrobacter, and Variovorax are the key players in a Scenedesmus quadricauda alga-bacteria interaction. We impart strong evidence that Dyadobacter produces and releases polysaccharides degradation enzymes and leucine-rich repeat proteins; Variovorax supplies the consortium with auxins and vitamin B12, while Porphyrobacter produces a broad spectrum of B vitamins. We show not only that the microalgae collaborate with the bacteria and vice versa but also that the bacteria interact with each other via quorum-sensing and secretion system mechanisms. The shared currency between partners appears to be vitamins, microalgae growth-promoting substances, and dissolved carbon. }

  abstract = {Abstract Building models is essential for understanding the functions and dynamics of microbial communities. Metabolic models built on genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are especially relevant as a means to decipher the complex interactions occurring among species. Model reconstruction increasingly relies on metagenomics, which permits direct characterisation of naturally occurring communities that may contain organisms that cannot be isolated or cultured. In this review, we provide an overview of the field of metabolic modelling and its increasing reliance on and synergy with metagenomics and bioinformatics. We survey the means of assigning functions and reconstructing metabolic networks from (meta-)genomes, and present the variety and mathematical fundamentals of metabolic models that foster the understanding of microbial dynamics. We emphasise the characterisation of interactions and the scaling of model construction to large communities, two important bottlenecks in the applicability of these models. We give an overview of the current state of the art in metagenome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, focusing on the reconstruction of genomes in microbial communities. Metagenomics benefits tremendously from third-generation sequencing, and we discuss the opportunities of long-read sequencing, strain-level characterisation and eukaryotic metagenomics. We aim at providing algorithmic and mathematical support, together with tool and application resources, that permit bridging the gap between metagenomics and metabolic modelling.}
