> BEST PRACTICE
>
> Having an already optimal co-occurrence network to annotate is essential from a biological point-of-view.
> Thus, we strongly suggest you first build your co-occurrence network using FlashWeave or any inference tool 
> on your own, in order to address the idiosyncracy of your data the best you can. 
> In the framework of microbetag, you can do that by running the pre-processing Docker image we provide and by editing the
> `flashweave.jl` script (see the [preparation step](input.md#the-preparation) as well as the [FlashWeave documentation](https://githubhelp.com/meringlab/FlashWeave.jl) for more).
