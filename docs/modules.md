## Callouts
{: .d-inline-block }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

To use this feature, you need to configure a `color` and (optionally) `title` for each kind of callout you want to use, e.g.:

```yaml
callouts:
  warning:
    title: Warning
    color: red
```

This uses the color `$red-000` for the background of the callout, and `$red-300` for the title and box decoration.[^dark] You can then style a paragraph as a `warning` callout like this:

```markdown
{: .warning }
A paragraph...
```

[^dark]:
    If you use the `dark` color scheme, this callout uses `$red-300` for the background, and `$red-000` for the title.

The colors `grey-lt`, `grey-dk`, `purple`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, and `red` are predefined; to use a custom color, you need to define its `000` and `300` levels in your SCSS files. For example, to use `pink`, add the following to your `_sass/custom/setup.scss` file:

```scss
$pink-000: #f77ef1;
$pink-100: #f967f1;
$pink-200: #e94ee1;
$pink-300: #dd2cd4;
```

You can override the default `opacity` of the background for a particular callout, e.g.:

```yaml
callouts:
  custom:
    color: pink
    opacity: 0.3
```

You can change the default opacity (`0.2`) for all callouts, e.g.:

```yaml
callouts_opacity: 0.3
```

You can also adjust the overall level of callouts.
The value of `callouts_level` is either `quiet` or `loud`;
`loud` increases the saturation and lightness of the backgrounds.
The default level is `quiet` when using the `light` or custom color schemes,
and `loud` when using the `dark color scheme.`

## Google Analytics

{: .warning }
> [Google Analytics 4 will replace Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528). On **July 1, 2023**, standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new hits. The earlier you migrate, the more historical data and insights you will have in Google Analytics 4.

Universal Analytics (UA) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) properties are supported.

```yaml
# Google Analytics Tracking (optional)
# Supports a CSV of tracking ID strings (eg. "UA-1234567-89,G-1AB234CDE5")
ga_tracking: UA-2709176-10
ga_tracking_anonymize_ip: true # Use GDPR compliant Google Analytics settings (true/nil by default)
```
