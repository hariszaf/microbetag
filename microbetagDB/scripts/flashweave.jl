"""
microbetag is working as a set of workflows that consists of tools
This script runs FlashWeave to get a co-occurrence network based on 
an OTU or ASV table (mandatory) and a metadata table (optional)

Essential parameters:
     n_obs_min - don't compute associations between variables having less reliable samples 
                 (i.e. non-zero if heterogeneous=true) than this number.
                  -1: automatically choose a threshold.

     track_rejections - store for each discarded edge, which variable set lead to its exclusion (can be memory intense for large networks)

     transposed - if true, rows of data are variables and columns are samples
