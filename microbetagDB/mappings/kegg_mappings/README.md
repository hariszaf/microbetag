# Parsing KEGG modules

## Aim

This script is going to run **once** for **all** NCBI Id pairs present in our database so we have all the complementarities as part of the back end. 


## Structure

The KEGG modules definitions are parsed and devided in steps.
Each step may has alternatives:

- single KOs (e.g., step 1 in `md:M00022`)
- substeps (e.g., one of the alternatives in step 2 in `md:M000022` include `K01735` > `K03785` > `K00014`)

```JSON

rules:

- `;` stands for next   $\rightarrow$ add
- `,` stands for OR     $\rightarrow$ split
- `+` stands for complex
- `-` stands for not needed

we need a `while` for the  `\(([^)]+)\)` regex

parts = re.findall("\((([^\(\)]*)|(\?R))*\)", md23)

def nested_parens(n):
   if n == 0:
      return ['']
   parens = []
   for i in range(n):
      for a in nested_parens(i):
         for b in nested_parens(n - 1 - i):
            parens.append('(' + a + ')' + b)
   return parens
