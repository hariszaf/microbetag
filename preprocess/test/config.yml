abundance_table_file: 
  path: test.tsv
  description: Path to abundance table file. Attention! The path needs to be within the folder that you mount to the Docker container.
  type: Path

metadata_file: 
  path: null
  description: Path to metadata file. Metadata describe the abundance table and is going to be used for building the cooccurrence network. For an example file see https://github.com/meringlab/FlashWeave.jl/tree/master/test/data/HMP_SRA_gut. Remember that each column stands for a trait and each row its corresponding value to each sample.

16s_gtdb_taxonomy_assign:
  value: True
  description: Taxonomy assignment of the sequences using IDTAXA and the 16S sequences of the GTDB genomes.
  type: bool

map_users_taxonomy_to_microbetags:
  value: False
  taxonomy: other
  description: To annotate the network based on the user's taxonomy assignment, a map between their taxonomy and microbetag's is required. In this case, the abundance table needs to have the taxonomies in the last column instead of the sequences. In case that GTDB or Silva was used for the taxonomy assignment of bins/amplicons, set this in the taxonomy argument, otherwise set this as "other".
